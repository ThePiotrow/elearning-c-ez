## QCM - Docker Compose: Docker for Microservices Strategies
<br>
<br>


### **Question** : What are the advantage(s) of microservice architecture over monolithic architecture when developing software applications?

> `Modularity`

> `Distributed development`

> `Scalability`


#
### **Question** : Which is a possible reason(s) for a large standard deviation between repeated benchmark test results?

> `Inconsistent environment setup`

> `The duration of tests is too short`


#
### **Question** : What is the purpose(s) of using an API Gateway to secure a microservices application?

> `Delegate authentication and authorization to a central location`

> `Place a firewall in front of each microservice in a microservices application`


#
### **Question** : Which type of API do microservices implement most commonly in modern applications?

> `REST`


#
### **Question** : Which could be challenge(s) when attempting to refactor a monolithic legacy application to a microservice architecture?

> `Separating data ownership into multiple microservices`

> `Defining APIs for each individual microservice`

> `Managing application constraints and dependencies`


#
### **Question** : Which are considerations to take into account when designing a microservice architecture using Docker containers?

> `How databases and data volumes will be separated from application logic`

> `Separation of concerns for microservices`

> `Which types of application monitoring tool to use`


#
### **Question** : Why is it better to have only a single microservice communicating with a database?

> `More flexibility for future database changes and schema updates`


#
### **Question** : Match the appropriate docker-compose command with its description.

List containers:

> `docker-compose ps`

Builds, creats and starts containers:

> `docker-compose up`

Stops and removes containers, volumes, and images:

> `docker-compose down`

Builds project services:

> `docker-compose build`


#
### **Question** : Which Amazon Web Services (AWS) Compute services can run Docker containers?

> `EC2`

> `Fargate`
