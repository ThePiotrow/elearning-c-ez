#
### **Question** : Once a docker image has been built, where can it be stored?

> `Docker registry`


### **Question** : The Docker REST API endpoint uses what kind of socket instead of a TCP one?

> `UNIX`


#
### **Question** : Which command can you use to test your Docker image locally?

> `docker run`


#
### **Question** : The Docker daemon can be configured by modifying which configuration file?

> `daemon.json`


#
### **Question** : Which are challenges associated with identifying the root cause of issues with microservice-based architecture?

> `Lack of observability`

> `Difficulties tracing errors`

#
### **Question** : Which are delivery modes that Docker uses for writing container logs?

> `Blocking`

> `Non-blocking`


#
### **Question** : Which is Docker's open-source script used to audit Docker containers against security benchmarks?

> `Docker bench`


#
### **Question** : Which command can be used for Docker Hub and for private registries to generate an authentication file?

> `docker login`


#
### **Question** : Which aspects of Docker containers can slow down builds?

> `Image size`


#
### **Question** : Two Docker containers running on the same host are using different operating systems from one another internal to their containers. When they run together, they use up all the disk storage on the host.

> `Resource constrained host`


#
### **Question** : Which Docker performance consideration can reduce the number of layers of an image?

> `Using chain commands`


#
### **Question** : What are the task(s) performed by container orchestration?

> `Scaling containers`

> `Networking between containers`

> `Managing hosts`


### **Question** : What are the benefit(s) of Docker orchestration tools?

> `Portability`

> `Simple deployments`

> `Security`

> `Quality`


#
### **Question** : Which cloud-based orchestration service(s) are designed to manage single stand-alone containers?

> `Azure Container Instances`

> `Google Cloud Run`


#
### **Question** : An organization writes software that processes oil well production. They create a container service that handles production data ingress. To handle increased ingress, the service scales out to multiple containers. Well sites send their ingress data to a common URL, where it is load balanced across the multiple containers.
### Which aspect(s) of orchestration and cluster management does the scaling of containers represent?

> `Orchestration`

> `Clustering`
